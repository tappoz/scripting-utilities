# Scripting utilities

This project was intended as a place to gather all the scripts I found useful recalling from the command line for my daily tasks.
They might be:

- `bash` / `awk` scripts,
- `python` scripts (or `jupyter` notebooks) e.g. bulk-email dispatch,
- `javascript` / `Node.js` scripts,
- snippets on Go (Golang), Java etc.

It evolved into a place where I also store some DevOps solutions based on Ansible, Terraform (AWS, Azure, GCP, UpCloud etc.), Docker and Kubernetes, Penetration Testing (CVE - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), SQL Injection, Vulnerability Scanning etc.

It slowly ended up into a place where I store most of my sample projects, MVP (Minimum Viable Products) or PoC (Proof of Concepts).
