# you need to have the GDAL package installed, e.g. under the debian umbrella OSs: 
# $ apt-get install gdal-bin
#
# to check if that package is installed type:
# $ dpkg -l | grep gdal

# ATTENTION! If you download a KMZ archive from Google Maps you can treat it as a normal ZIP file
#            so you can unzip the KML file inside which usually is "doc.kml"
#            (unzip YOUR_ARCHIVE.kmz doc.kml) 
#            then use it as the input of this bash script
#
# ATTENTION! Assuming the layers in the KML file do not contain spaces (e.g. "bla_bla_foo_bar")

# TODO: for some reason ogr2ogr inverts X and Y, 
#       i.e. those coordinates on Google Maps show in the middle of nowhere
#       so it would be good to swap X and Y columns in the CSV
#       so then they could be easily used to search on Google Maps
