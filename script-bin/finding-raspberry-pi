# This script comes useful when you need to find your Raspberry Pi
# in your local network at home or at friends' home. 
# The IP address might get assigned dinamically and you find yourself
# searching for your Pi's IP address over and over again...

# TODO 
# Fill the configuration file: 'finding-rpi_SAMPLE_.conf'
# with the relevant information regarding the MAC addresses
# of your Raspberry Pi for the:
# - wifi network interface
# - ethernet network interface
# Then rename that file to: 'finding-rpi.conf' in order to
# be sourced into this script.
