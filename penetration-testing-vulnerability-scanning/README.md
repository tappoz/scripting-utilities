# Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Scanning

All the source code is public at:

```
https://github.com/tappoz/scripting-utilities/tree/master/penetration-testing-vulnerability-scanning
```

## Scan Docker images and file systems

Check the `Makefile` on the directory: [trivy/](trivy/) where there's also 
a sample Node.js app with outdated dependencies to let Trivy find vulnerabilities.

You can scan:

- Docker images e.g. to find vulnerabilities in `.deb` packages.
- File system e.g. to find vulnerabilities in `.deb` packages, Java/Go/Node.js packages.

Anything that could be managed as a dependency by a dependency management system e.g. `apt`
can be scanned by Trivy.

## Penetration testing 

Check both these directories:

- [nuclei/](nuclei/)
- [sqlmap/](sqlmap/)

Both tools target the REST API at [sample-backend-rest-app/](sample-backend-rest-app/).
They aim at finding vulnerabilities via penetration testing on the HTTP endpoints, also with database SQL injection.

You need two terminals:

1. Run the HTTP REST API: `cd sample-backend-rest-app && make run`.
2. Run the penetration tests:
    1. `cd nuclei/` then check the `Makefile` for a variety of tests
    2. `cd sqlmap/` then check the `Makefile` for a variety of tests
